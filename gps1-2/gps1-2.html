            <p class="question">What is Pair Programming?</p>
            <p class="answer">Pair programming is when two people collaborate on the same project.
            Typically there is a driver and a navigator. </p>
            <p class="question">Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</p>
            <p class="answer">It is important because it holds students accountable and prepares boots to pair program
            in the work world.</p>
            <p class="question">Compare Driver and Navigator</p>
            <p class="answer">The driver types the code, while the navigator researches and guides the driver.</p>
            <p class="question">Reflect</p>
            <p class="answer">We enjoyed pair programming. Pair programming is fun.
            Driving and navigating worked. It made sense to define the roles at the beginning and
            have someone control the page while the other guided.
