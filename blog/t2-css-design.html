                <p>CSS positioning (displays included) is indeed my vice, so I decided to tackle the topic of inline and inline block head on.</p>
                <p>I found a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189810/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block">great resource</a> that was able to explain things in a bulleted list. Here's the gist of it:</p>
                <p>1. Inline allows for left and right margins. It also allows for other elements to sit on their left and right sides. It does not allow for a top and bottom margin/padding, and also cannot have a set width ahd height.</p>
                <p>2. Inline-block also allows for all of the above, but <b>also</b> allows for height, width, top and bottom margins/padding. It's the more flexible of both display values.</p>
                <p>In non-technical terms, I'm happy to use a interior decorating analogy, even though I'm horrible at interior design.</p>
                <p>Let's say we have a bookshelf with two shelves, one named "inline" and the other named "inline-block."</p>
                <p>In the inline shelf, I would like to have a pedestal, and on the pedestal I'd like to put antiques to the left, right, AND on top of it. Let's also say the pedestal also has compartments and mini-storage cubbies below it, I would like to store some precious artifacts in there too, so I do and it works perfect.</p>
                <p>In the inline-block shelf, however, I want to have a candle on the shelf that I use often. Therefore, I <b>can't</b> put anything on top of the candle or on the bottom (where the melted wax collects), BUT I <b>can</b> put picture frames and other antiques to the left and right of it.</p>
                <p>Phew, I don't know if that was the simplest of analogies, but hopefully it makes sense. I'm still struggling on learning the differences myself, and hope that explaining it in this blog will help me (and all of you that are reading this) out in coding for the future.</p>
