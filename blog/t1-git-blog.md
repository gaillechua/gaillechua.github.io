  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),

#### Version Controls, Git, and GitHub, Oh My!
#### September 18, 2014

Version control is a term I've heard a lot in the past and understood the concept in either very abstract or very macroscopic ways. Basically, I viewed it through the lens of a web and software project manager. After reading the material for this lesson, however, I've grasped it way better than before. An all-encompassing description, at least for the purpose of web or software development, would be this: version control is a system that will continuously track changes made to code, such that those previous changes can be retrieved later for reference, review, or evaluation.

So, how does git track changes? I'll admit - I had to ask this question in Google to figure out how to explain it in n00b terms because, I AM a n00b! From what I understand, git tracks changes each time the writer of the work explicity saves the work. There are various steps by which the work actually moves from being a work-in-progress, to a first draft, to a piece of work that is ready to be released to its audience, to a place where it's actually in front of its audience. The significance of tracking changes though is that the writer can then go back and recall the "save points" to see where things may have gone wrong.

The benefits of GitHub with regard to storing code are great for collaborative projects. Not only can you have your collaborators review your code, but you can make sure that your updates and your collaborators updates are merged, but without overwriting or conflicting each others' work! It is a great a way to work on a project together, while making sure you are on the same page with the updates that others' have committed to, and also making sure that all the work functions correctly once it's pieced together. In summary, and like the name suggests, GitHub is a "hub" where people can share their work, make improvements together on it, and also build something together without the worries of having multiple versions or conflicting work that might cause cause mishaps or conflicts all throughout.
