                <p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I found DBC to closely match my personal criteria of what I was hoping for in a developers' program. One that I thought would be a nice-to-have was the emphasis of a supportive and collaborative work environment. I knew it would be a huge step outside of my comfort zone and boy, did I eat my words.</p>

                <p>Before I delve further into how it's been, I have to reiterate that I am very happy that DBC focuses on pair programming so much. Each session so far has proven that we can gain a lot of insight from our fellow boots and guides, whether it is learning new concepts, work styles, or even learning about yourself and how you handle situations (good or bad) in a group setting. I'd still be swimming in fire on Week 1's challenges had it not been for the help of some awesome fellow boots. It's also been great to relate with cohort mates on a personal level, learning about different backgrounds and also common/not-so-common struggles within the program.</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://surethatsfine.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1452289_674220065935477_1655219875_n.jpg" height="307" width="271"/></p>

                <p>That said, I have had more anxiety-ridden internal battles than exciting ones when it comes to pairing in general. While I know that it's been super helpful for me and my understanding of the curriculum, my concern is always whether I will slow the pace down unecessarily, or be more so of a burden because of my lack of knowledge in a challenge. Being respectful and considerate of my partner's time has always been a priority, so with that I want to come prepared and as knowledgeable as I can be. I have found it a personal routine to review the challenges with the goal of being able to contribute as much as the next person without bogging down the time.</p>

                <p>I have not found a frustrating moment in the pair sessions on account of the other person, but rather just within my own anxious thoughts. I think the lack of confidence during these sessions has to do with introvert tendencies. Freezing up during my latest GPS sessions, for example, have been the worst. I think I know what's next, but just...can't..seem...to...get it out. Anyway, after chatting with a few boots, I know I'm not the only one, which is a little comforting.</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://rs1img.memecdn.com/teamwork_o_288110.jpg" width="266" height="305"/></p>

                <p>The good news is that every guide and cohort mate so far has been very understanding, patient, and helpful. It's been so rewarding to work through a problem after hours on end, with such enthusiam and like-minded work ethics for each session. And to share that feeling of accomplishment with another person makes it even better! I couldn't have chosen a better group to go into such foreign territory with, and make me feel at most ease as I possibly can.</p>

                <p>Giving and receiving feedback has also been helpful in relieving the internal tension. Many have expressed such kind words of encouragement and relatability when I've struggled with challenges or the pace of the session. Boots have also been very candid with suggestions on how to approach future pairing sessions and challenges, which is certainly something I embrace and appreciate.</p>
                <p>The cool part is that I value the importance of providing feedback to others and am glad that this is a requirement of DBC's curriculum. While I sometimes struggle to find words to express my thanks in real-time during the session, I don't want my appreciation for fellow boots to go unnoticed, so I make sure that I specifically call it out in the feedback portion. And just as the constructive and actionable feedback has helped me along the way, I too am happy to provide kind words of encouragement and tips to improve for others (although any real criticisms have been few and far between). There hasn't been any difficulty doing this so far, just because, as I mentioned above, I haven't really experienced a legitimate point of frustration that warranted heavy criticisms. Hopefully that won't ever be the case.</p>

                <p>I look forward to this collaborative work culture carrying over to when we all meet. And as uncomfortable as it might be at first, I'm sure that it will be worth it at the end. I also commend DBC for setting a higher standard for this culture, because as future DBC graduates we can transfer this attitude to our workplaces, hopefully eradicating all those gnarly and misunderstood programmer stereotypes.</p>
