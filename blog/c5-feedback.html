                <p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I found DBC to closely match my personal criteria of what I was hoping for in a developers' program. One that I thought would be a nice-to-have was the emphasis of a supportive and collaborative work environment. I knew it would be a huge step outside of my comfort zone and boy, did I eat my words.</p>

                <p>Before I delve further into how it's been, I have to reiterate that I am very happy that DBC focuses on pair programming so much. Each session (so far at least) has proven that we can gain a lot of insight from our fellow boots and guides, whether it is learning new concepts, work styles, or even learning about yourself and how to handle situations (good or bad) in a group setting. I'd still be swimming in fire on Week 1's challenges had it not been for the help of some fellow boots. It's also been great to relate with cohort mates on a personal level, learning about our different backgrounds and opinions about the program.</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://surethatsfine.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1452289_674220065935477_1655219875_n.jpg" height="307" width="271"/></p>

                <p>That said, I have had way more anxiety-ridden internal battles than optimistic ones when it comes to pairing in general. While I know that it's been super helpful for me and my understanding of the curriculum, my concern is always whether I will slow the pace down unecessarily, or be a burden because of my lack of knowledge in the curriculum. Being respectful and considerate of my partner's time has always been a priority, so with that I want to come prepared and as knowledgeable as I can be. I've committed to a personal routine of reviewing challenges prior to pairing sessions because I feel as though I need the extra time to digest it all.</p>

                <p>I should note that I have not yet encountered a hugely frustrating session on account of the other person, but rather just within my own scope. I can mostly attribute the lack of confidence during these sessions with introvert tendencies. Freezing up during my latest GPS sessions, for example, have been the worst. I think I know what's next, but just...can't...seem...to...get it out. But after chatting with a few boots, I know I'm not the only one, which is a little comforting.</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://rs1img.memecdn.com/teamwork_o_288110.jpg" width="266" height="305"/></p>

                <p>The good news is that everyone so far has been accommodating and helpful. It's also been rewarding to work through a problem after hours on end, with a like-minded enthusiasm and work ethic for each session. And to share that feeling of accomplishment with another person makes it worth it at the end. I think this is a pretty stellar group to approach foreign territory with. Hopefully it stays that way.</p>

                <p>Giving and receiving feedback has also been helpful in relieving internal tension. Many have expressed such kind words and relatability when I've struggled with challenges or the pace of the session. Boots have been very candid with suggestions on how to approach future pairing sessions and challenges, which is certainly something I embrace.</p>

                <p>The cool part is that I value the importance of providing feedback to others and am glad that this is a requirement of DBC's curriculum. I often struggle to find words to express my thanks in real-time during the session, and I don't want my appreciation for fellow boots to go unnoticed. I make sure that I specifically call it out in the feedback portion. And just as actionable feedback has helped me along the way, I too am happy to provide kind words of encouragement and tips for improvement for others, although any heavy criticisms have been few and far between. There hasn't been any difficulty doing this so far, just because, as I mentioned above, I haven't really experienced a legitimate point of frustration that warrants heavy criticisms. Hopefully that won't ever be the case, because I have a problem with being confrontational sometimes. Eeps.</p>

                <p>I look forward to this collaborative work culture carrying over to when we all meet. And as uncomfortable as it might be at first, I'm almost certain that it will be worth it at the end. I also commend DBC for setting a higher standard for this culture, because as future DBC graduates we can transfer this attitude to our workplaces, hopefully eradicating all those gnarly and misunderstood programmer stereotypes.</p>
