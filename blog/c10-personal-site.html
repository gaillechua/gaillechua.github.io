                <p>Phase 0 is winding down and to sum it all, it has been an enlightening experience. One of our last assignments was to polish and update our personal website with our new skills, whether it was adding simple jQuery animations or adding more interactivity and visuals based on feedback from our users. This has been one of the more fulfilling assignments thoughout Phase 0, in part because it was nice to apply a lot that we had learned to an actual working site that we could call our own.</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-03/enhanced/webdr02/3/13/anigif_enhanced-buzz-23992-1393873046-14.gif" height="225" width="400"></p>

                <p>There are quite a few things I've learned after updating my site. One of the the more important concepts is learning to be content with your progress and knowing you can go back to a project later in order to move on to another project. Some projects, like my personal website, will always be a work in progress. And though it pains me to say this, I don't think I will ever be satisfied. There will always be more I will want to add, whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or just polishing the bells and whistles. It doesn't help that we are learning so much at DBC that makes us so eager to apply to actual living, breathing projects.</p>

                <p>While every fix and enhancement in a project will have its rewards, this also echoes the importance of time boxing and recognizing when "rabbit holes" are worth one's time. As a former project manager in the web design and development space, one of my most difficult tasks was to let clients know when their requests were no longer in scope of the work we had agreed on. In the same vein, and as a former employee that was also on the client side, we always stressed the importance of receiving a near-perfect-to-perfect deliverable from our designers and developers. I understand both sides pretty well, and through working on my site, also realize that a even a "perfect" product in web development will need continuous work. So it's crucial to learn when to put your foot down as either a client or a developer, and to choose your rabbit holes carefully.</p>
