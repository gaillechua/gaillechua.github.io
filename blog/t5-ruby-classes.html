                <p>Phew! The use of classes along with instance variables and methods has been somewhat confusing this week. While I understand the high-level concept of why and when they are used, I am still trying to grasp what can and can't be done within (and without) them.</p>

                <p>I do know that classes in Ruby is what makes the language so powerful, though. Hopefully by the end of this post, I will have a more solid understanding of why. I'll push forward with using cars as an example class to help better understand the concept (for you and me both). Here goes nothing!</p>

                <div id="code"><code>
                1 class Cars<br>
                2 &nbsp;&nbsp; def initialize(make, model, year)<br>
                3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @make = make<br>
                4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @model = model<br>
                5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @year = year<br>
                6 &nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
                7 <br>
                8 &nbsp;&nbsp; def display_car_stats<br>
                9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a #{@make} #{@model} made in #{@year}!"<br>
                10&nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
                11 end<br>
                </code></div>

                <p><code><b>Initialize</b></code> (line 2) is a special method in Ruby programs. When you call <code><b>Cars.new</b></code> to create a new <code><b>Cars</b></code> object, Ruby creates an uninitialized object and then calls that object's initialize method, passing in any parameters that were passed to new. The parameters we have identified are make, model, and year (line 2). This gives you a chance to write code that sets up your object's state (this explanation has been modified and derived from <a href="http://phrogz.net/programmingruby/tut_classes.html"><b>source</b></a>).</p>

                <p>The <code><b>"@"</b></code> sign in lines 3-5 above is used to store local variables as <b>instance variables</b>. This will allow the variables to be accessed outside of the various methods in a class. This also implies that instance variables change from object to object.</p>

                <p>So why would we need a class of cars, as demonstrated by the example above? Each car will have a set of characteristics. For example, we used 3 parameters - make, model, and year - to help us identify each car. Of course, there could be many more characteristics (i.e. car color, 0-60mph rate, etc.), but we want to keep it simple for the sake of this example. The main takeaway here is that it each new object (car) will have these declared characteristics that will be stored and will help us identify them for later use, like in instance methods. It also saves us a lot of time and energy, especially if we have hundreds of cars with different characteristics to list.</p>

                <p>Let's say we want to add a new car with its characteristics in our class. This is how it looks:</p>

                <div id="code"><code><br>
                Cars.new("Subaru", "Impreza", "2011")<br><br>
                </code></div>

                <p> Here we've created a new object, in our case a car. By defining our Cars class, we can group behaviors and characteristics that our cars have. We can also use the methods within the class and apply it to this car or any other car that has been created.</p>

                <p>So let's use the <code><b>display_car_stats</b></code> method from our class (line 8)! Here's what happens once we've inputted the new Car object that I have named <code><b>mysubie</b></code>:</p>

                <div id="code"><code>
                <br>mysubie = Cars.new("Subaru", "Impreza", "2011")<br><br>
                mysubie.display_car_stats<br><br>
                # => "I am a Subaru Impreza made in 2011!"<br><br>
                </code></div>

                <p>Note that in our class code above, we call out our instance variables within the <code><b>Cars#display_car_stats</b></code> method with the following syntax: <code><b>#{@make} #{@model} #{@year}</b></code>. Another sidenote to remember is that we can identify Class methods with the following syntax (which I use at the beginning of this paragraph: <code><b>Class#method_name</b></code>.</p>

                <p>Woo! I just tested it all in IRB and it works just fine. I'm hoping to do more within classes, i.e. modifying objects and applying other methods for only certain objects (and not all). Perhaps there will be a Part 2 of this post soon!</p>

                <p>Cheers!</p>
