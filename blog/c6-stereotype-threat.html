                <p>Yikes, Stereotype Threat. As someone who tries to avoid uncomfortable confrontations as much as possible, I walk a very fine line on when topics like this should be raised for discussion. That's not to say, however, that I haven't experienced it and have not taken action against it. In this post, I'll discuss a few personal experiences related to Streotype Threat, and how I have handled it not only from a first-person perspective, but as a witness to others experiencing it as well.</p>


                <p>Snowboarding, has always been a therapeutic outlet for me. I like to try harder trails and advance my skill level in terrain parks. But with that comes forethought. I am by no means the most seasoned rider and as a beginner in expert terrain, I don't want to get in the way of the the more experienced riders. I err on the side of caution, thinking, "I'm a girl, have less strength, might make more mistakes, and consequently might cause more problems for the riders around me, especially since they're mostly guys." As a result and in consideration of the regular riders, I limit my time around those trails and tend to go when I know that there will be less people around.</p>

                <p>This is an example of Stereotype Threat, which is more formally defined as, "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">(source)</a>.</p>

                <p>In the same vein, taking the risk of attending DBC has led to some thoughts of how I might reinforce stereotypes in the program as a girl, as a former liberal arts student, and as a relatively older student compared to the rest of the boots. There are moments when I put in extra time in the curriculum because I feel like I need to compensate for the perception of being less knowledgeable or having a slower learning pace. I don't necessarily think putting extra study time is a bad thing, but the intention behind it should not be because I assume I have a steeper learning curve based on my "characteristics." Rather, this should stem directly from wanting to stay diligent and keeping on track with DBC's curriculum.</p>

                <p>The consequences can become a little obvious not just to myself, but to others. Take pair and GPS sessions, for example. Sometimes I don't feel too confident coming into these sessions. I end up staying reserved and reluctant to express ways to troubleshoot some of the challenges. It often becomes obvious to others. Some of my pair partners have suggested for me to be more assertive and to take more leaps of faith in the sessions. These are tips that help me recognize when I've let Stereotype Threat affect me, so I'm appreciative of fellow boots providing constructive words of encouragement.</p>

                <p>That said, I've also seen it happen secondhand. I am very close to someone who tends to blame his circumstances for why he hasn't reached his professional, relationship, and social goals. It's heartbreaking to hear that, when he pursues a girl, he thinks he is always "friendzoned" because of his physical characteristics or personality traits. He also feels as though he cannot advance as quickly in his career because he is "older" and less experienced than others his age. To top it all off, he blames his shy and introverted tendencies for why he has a very small circle of friends. Talk about a triple stereotype threat, right? It is truly unfortunate that so much potential is missed based on his own assumptions of possibly fitting into a stereotype.</p>

                <p>Handling Stereotype Threat is easier said that done, and takes a lot of introspective thinking. Taking risks in life is great and taking calculated risk is even better. I think it's okay to be more aware of your tendencies in consideration of others, but you shouldn't let that hold you back from pursuing goals. While Stereotype Threat is still an ongoing struggle for me, I think the easiest way to handle it is to identify when it's happening and listen to those who recognize it with you and encourage you to combat it. Also, look at the cases of people who beat similar stereotypes to yours. If it is possible for them, then it is certainly possible for you.</p>
