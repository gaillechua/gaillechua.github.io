                <p>Before I dive into this post, I want to mention that it's been a little foreign for me to be so introspective in the midst of keeping busy with the day-to-day of my job and Phase 0 challenges. I was pleasantly surprised to find that writing cultural and technical blogs have been encouraging and therapeutic, so I'm glad it's part of the curriculum. Welp, that's that. Next subject!</p>

                <p>According to the personal thinking style quiz, I am <b>Concrete Sequential</b>, which means I am most comfortable thinking in a realistic, ordered, and linear process.</p>
                <p>I think I can leverage my thinking style by looking at DBC's resources that explain things in a more step-by-step process. This includes videos and documentation that have been provided as references, that I can check back on before, during, and after doing the various challenges and assignments.</p>

                <p>That sounds pretty easy, right? Kind of. I think throughout my academic and post-academic careers, it <i>was</i> implied to think in this way, so I thrived in those settings. But, as I've experienced in Phase 0 of DBC, my biggest struggles have to do with <i>not</i> exploring challenges beyond the steps and resources that I am provided with. Phase 0 challenges essentially ask us as learners to be more curious and experimental with not just simply reaching a solution, <i>but</i> also finding our own process to that solution. This is clearly against the grain of my preferred thinking style, and is something that I'm gradually trying to embrace and am eager to learn more about.</p>

                <p>But, with an eager outlook comes a mindset that reinforces that one can broaden learning without feeling discouraged by what one thinks is his or her "natural circumstances," i.e. a fixed mindset. Admittedly, there have been numerous times in the past where I blamed my "brain" for learning some subjects easier than others. I considered myself a "liberal arts student," always choosing assignments and topics that were in my comfort zone, like writing essays or creating multimedia presentations. But, with changing my mindset by embracing unfamiliar obstacles, accepting failure as part of the process, and cultivating new skills and methods of learning, some of my most farfetched goals will actually be worth a shot.</p>

                <p>My plan of action to tackle DBC in Phase 0 (and beyond) is pretty straightforward: embrace my linear thinking process whenever applicable, but also stay enthusiastic in exercising the other learning processes that seem to be preferable when doing DBC assignments.</p>

                <p>In the weeks to come, I sincerely (and nervously) look forward to stepping beyond my comfort zone and evolving my learning and thinking methods. Hopefully with a enthusiastic outlook, it'll be easier to adapt for not just DBC but for life's "dreadful" obstacles in general.</p>

                <p>Cheers!</p>
