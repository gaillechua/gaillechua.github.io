                <p>Phase 0 is winding down and to sum it all, it has been an enlightening experience. One of our last assignments was to polish and update our personal website with our new skills, whether it was adding simple jQuery animations or adding more interactivity and visuals based on feedback from our users. This has been one of the more fulfilling assignments thoughout Phase 0, in part because it was nice to apply a lot that we had learned to an actual working site that we could call our own.<p>

                <p>Over the years, in school and at the workplace, I've learned that while no question is a dumb question, that doesn't mean I can frame them with half-assed effort. The closer you are to a detailed - but succinct - question, you'll be doing not only yourself a service, but others a service as well. Then, your dumb questions aren't just dumb, they're good and dumb. Kidding - they're not dumb!<p>

                As someone who always tries to avoid confrontation at all costs, my gut reaction to all tense situations is, "How can I resolve, but also make the swiftest exit out of this mess?" While I think my reaction to avoid conflict seems like the best course of action, admittedly there have been times where it has actually backfired.

                Now that we're winding down to our last days before immersive classes, I <i>guess</i> it's time to stop avoiding and start thinking about key programming concepts like recursion. And since we're on the topic, I don't know if my current headache was worsened by the thought of it, or if recursion spurred the headache to begin with. Is that how it works? Gah...

                When I think about life's <i>deeper</i> questions related to personal growth, relationships, and values, I can't help but remember taking the silly quizzes in Seventeen Magazine. While I frankly have a tough time taking introspection so seriously, I think I subconsciously thought they would help me reflect. I mean, this is why I have resigned to BuzzFeed quizzes. Also because it's cool and hip.

            Ruby vs. JavaScript: What's So Different?

                  The beauty of Ruby and JavaScript is that there are a myriad of ways to define, execute, and write them to reach the same goal. The flexibility is mostly great. We have the freedom to determine what way is the most suitable and preferential to use for our work. But it is also that awesome wizardy and syntax similarity that can cause confusion. Because the differences are less noticeable between languages, those subtleties can inevitably lead to numerous, frustrating, face-palming errors in code.

                  Yikes, Stereotype Threat. As someone who tries to avoid uncomfortable confrontations as much as possible, I walk a very fine line on when topics like this should be raised for discussion. That's not to say, however, that I haven't experienced it and have not taken action against it. In this post, I'll discuss a few personal experiences related to Streotype Threat, and how I have handled it not only from a first-person perspective, but as a witness to others experiencing it as well.

                  In Ruby, there are different types of closures: blocs, procs, lambdas. Closures are blocks of code (functions) that have the ability to have scope only within its boundaries. It can store and access non-local variables of that function. Let's look at their characteristics and compare code examples.
