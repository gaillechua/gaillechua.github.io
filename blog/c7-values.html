                <p>When I think about life's <i>deeper</i> questions related to personal growth, relationships, and values, I can't help but remember taking the silly quizzes in Seventeen Magazine. While I frankly have a tough time taking introspection so seriously, I think I subconsciously think these light-hearted tools would help me reflect. I mean, this is why I have resigned to BuzzFeed quizzes. Also because it's cool and hip.</p>

                <p>That said, as I get older, I realize how beneficial it is to evaluate yourself, the values and priorities you hold, and how to improve upon them while also learning how to evolve. When thinking of the times in my life where I've been happiest, proudest, and satisfied, I believe I can associate the following values to those moments: integrity, helping others, growth, relationships, and compassion.</p><br>

                <p align="center"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/255920_892303509697_2649672_o.jpg" height="417" width="297"/><br><font size="2px">Gramps in his Navy days</font></p>

                <p>While I feel that those values and associated feelings are all great, there is one that I did not see and that I find most rewarding: selflessness. I was raised by my grandfather, who always put himself before others, but at the same time, recognized when he needed to better himself before lending a helping hand. I was and still am humbled by this trait, and try my best to reflect it towards friends, family, and strangers alike.</p>

                <p>Going back to the values that I chose, DBC has asked me to rate how much I try to live up to them based on this scale: <p align="center"><b>Disagree 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 Agree</b><br><br>
                Integrity: 5<br>
                Helping Others: 4<br>
                Growth: 3<br>
                Relationships: 3<br>
                Compassion: 4</p>

                <p>I try, but it's always easier said than done.</p>

                <p>Moreover, the last topic a handful of people asked my advice for was for career choices. I tend to view a career as not just a 9-5 on/off switch, but something that takes up a lot of time in our lives and therefore should be worth our while. Whatever that means is subjective to that person alone. Keeping that in mind, I try to advise others to make career choices that are not based on shallow or impulsive moves, but are rather sensible for their values.</p>

                <p>Tying this in with the dreaded Stereotype Threat, I think that my values tend to deviate from feelings of accomplishment coming from academic or career achievements. My drive for competition and advancing in challenges has never been super demanding. This can be a little troublesome especially if I need to stay motivated when I feel like I can't grasp the material or stay on pace with DBC's curriculum. But, at the same time, I think that my current values of integrity and growth helps in a sense that I want to give it my all, and make sure the journey is worthwhile even if I do fall short. I think that, when it's all said and done, I hope to feel validated from having give it 100%, rather than feeling validated from something like scoring a dream job after DBC. Though I admit, that would be a cool bonus!</p>
