                <p>Prior to my accepted at Dev Bootcamp, I did a lot of research on various code schools and had a set list of criteria that I wanted each to meet: locality, duration of program, cost, etc. I didn't realize until mid-search that being a woman would also factor into my decision.</p>

                <p>I learned that there were tons of exclusive offers for women, scholarships, discounts, workshops, and even whole code schools dedicated to women coders in tech! I was (and still am) humbled and appreciative that DBC, among other programs, recognize that gender inequality is a tech issue and are trying to help remedy the problem.</p>

                <p>That said, I am not oblivious to the large discrepancy between the male and female makeup in the tech industry, and the issues that fester within that discrepancy in tons of workplaces. In fact, I saw this on my Twitter feed yesterday:</p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JmuAeGt.png" width="504" height="139"/></p>

                <p>An <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/10/10/3578499/ghc-male-allies-panel/">article</a> posted by ThinkProgress on the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing further sums up what is happening in the tech world:

                  <div id="code"><i>Recent diversity reports from tech giants including Twitter, Yahoo, and Google have affirmed the industry's stereotypes, highlighting that the vast majority of employees are white men -- even in non-tech jobs. Women applying for tech jobs are often discouraged or simply turned away by tech companies because it's assumed they aren't qualified or don't 'fit' the culture Once hired, women often face gender harassment, discrimination in the tech workplace, and significantly lower pay."</i></div><p>

                <p>Sad, right? Even for Silicon Valley, in a state <i>and</i> area of the state that folks pride for having the most diverse and cultured population, <i>that</i> still exists? One would think that, in a sector that has so much progress in terms of technology and business, that the same rate of progress would happen on an ethical aspect as well. Sadface.</p>

                <p>As a naturally anxious person and after realizing that this is still a very relevant issue, I started projecting what life would be like in the work world after graduating. Would it become an issue for me, as aloof and enthusiastic as I've been in past jobplaces? Will this affect my attitude in the workplace? Will I become on guard and working on a little island with little acknowledgement and recognition? Eeeps!</p>

                <p>That may seem a bit extreme, and to be quite honest, it's not something that has really swayed my decision on my career path after DBC. There is hope!</p>

                <p>Like I mentioned with the women-oriented scholarships and schools, there are so many efforts that are trying to alleviate the problem. There are male advocates that are using numerous ways to get the word out and find ways to bring gender equality to the work place. TechCrunch recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/10-men-making-waves-for-women-in-tech/">wrote</a> about 10 of those men that are making a huge impact. Even the tweets by Linkedin Engineer and Ruby hacker Chris Eppstein that I referenced above is impactful.


                <p>Gender inequality in tech, let alone gender inequality at work, has never been as eye-opening as it is now for me. It's something that I never really experienced to such a degree, but it is now something that I will continue to be vigilant and proactive about. I hope to make this subject less of a touchy subject by just simply contributing to the tech workforce soon. A little goes a long way, I'm hoping.</p>

                <p>Then maybe we can all save the world later?</p>
