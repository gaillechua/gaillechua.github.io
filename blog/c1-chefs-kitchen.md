DBC Challenge: Accepted
Stepping out of my comfort zone in more ways than one
September 18, 2014

Based on Shereef's Fireside Chat video, DBC seems to hold the highest value in taking a holistic, collaborative approach to the program, rather than a pragmatic, linear one.

My impression of DBC is, well, that I am very impressed! While DBC continues to emphasize that students in the program work their asses off and code day in and out, they also put focus on the mental and physical health of each person there. DBC clearly could be taken at face value, and DBC could simply just give a curriculum with a price tag attached to it. But they don't. Their emphasis on engineering empathy, being relational, and meditative gives me confidence that DBC is thinking in the best interest of their students.

Also, my expectations of DBC have not changed, but have been reaffirmed in a positive way. I am completely committed to the program and do expect that DBC will teach me more than just learning a language, or the mere building materials to a masterpiece. Rather, I expect that DBC will guide me and help me discipline myself towards lifelong principles, habits, and processes that will ultimately be applied to not just work life, but life in general.

That's not to say I haven't struggled with my own thoughts in this early stage, however. I've had a rollercoaster of emotions from the moment I found out I was accepted, to the moment I put down my deposit, to the moment of going through prep material, to the moment I started this first week of Phase 0 curriculum. A lot of insecurities came up, but with all of that said, I think I've come out a bit more confident and excited in knowing that the upcoming DBC environment will be supportive and in a great condition to thrive in.
