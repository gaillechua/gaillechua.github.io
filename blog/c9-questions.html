        Good, Dumb Questions

          <div class="blogsubtitle">
            There's no such thing as a dumb question - a <i>good</i> dumb question

                <p>Over the years, in school and at the workplace, I've learned that while no question is a dumb question, that doesn't mean I can frame them with half-assed effort. The closer you are to a detailed - but succinct - question, you'll be doing not only yourself a service, but others a service as well.<p>

                <p align="center"><img src="http://blog.muchmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/awkward-eyes.gif"/></p>

                <p>But like comedian Donald Glover above, I still get self-conscious. Asking questions gets unnerving, especially if it might delay progress or if you feel like it's an obvious answer that you're just not getting. The easier thing is often to nod and act like you understand everything.</p>

                <p>Clearly, that is not the way to go about, especially at DBC and in programming, where it's absolutely crucial to understand the concepts, logic, and syntax of every character of code that you are writing. So the best way to be confident about asking "dumb" questions, is to ask <i>good</i> dumb questions - "good" as in good technique. Then, no questions are dumb questions!

                Based on my experience, and with research from DBC's resources (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">here</a>), this would be my criteria of a good, dumb question:</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Has your question already been asked and answered?</li>
                  <li>Have you checked and exhausted all of your current resources?</li>
                  <li>Can you explain the context of your question?</li>
                  <li>What is the goal you want out it?</li>
                  <li>Is your question clear and concise, but also detailed?</li>
                  <li>If applicable, can you reproduce or provide an example of the problem?</li>
                  <li>Can you reference anything that can supplement your question?</li>
                  <li>Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions!</li>
                  <li>Don't forget to proof-read your questions!</li>
                </ol>
                </div>

                <p>A few weeks ago, I asked a question in our cohort's Google+ page. I was in a hurry and didn't check previous posts to see if it was already addressed. It turned out it was, and one of my fellow boots linked me to that post. While I was grateful, I felt like I had just wasted people's time (including mine) writing out a question that was already answered. Good lesson learned, and just of many examples that have helped me become more confident in asking good, <strike>dumb</strike> questions.</p>

                <p>Cheers!</p>
